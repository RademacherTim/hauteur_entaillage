# Tapping below the lateral line does not reduce sap yield or quality significantly

This repository contains the data and code necessary for the reproduction of the analysis and figures of the manuscript entitled "Tapping below the lateral line does not reduce sap yield or quality significantly" by Rademacher et al., which is currently under preparation. We share the data in good faith for the transparency of science, but ask that any use is confirmed with the owners of the data.
